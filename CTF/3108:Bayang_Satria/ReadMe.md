Welcome to my personal writeup collection for **3108CTF: Bayang Satria**, organized by Bahtera Digital Technology in celebration of Malaysia's independence. This repo documents my journey through the challenges — from OSINT to Boot2Root — and reflects both technical growth and cultural appreciation.
