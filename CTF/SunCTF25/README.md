## Reflections

SunCTF 2025 was my **second onsite CTF**, and it truly elevated the experience. Competing alongside Zailan and Razalan from UiTM Shah Alam brought a fresh dynamic — we learned from each other, adapted quickly, and stayed grounded even when challenges humbled us.  
Placing **Top 37 out of 81 teams** was a proud moment, but more than that, it was about the tools we discovered, the connections we made, and the mindset we sharpened.
